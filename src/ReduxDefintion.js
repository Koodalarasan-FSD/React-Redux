Redux is a library for managing state in a predictable way in Javascript applications.
React-Redux is a library that provides bindings to use React and Redux together in an application.

Redux has Three core concepts such as 
1)store 2)action 3)reducer
1)store - A store that holds the state of your application.
2)action - An action that describes the changes in the state of the application.
3)reducer - A reducer which actually carries out the state transtition depending on the action.

Redux has three principles such as
First Principle:
"The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store"
Maintain our application state in a single object which would be managed by the Redux store.
Second Principle:
"The only way to change the state  is to emit an action, an object describing what happened"
To update the state of your app, you need to let Redux know about that with an action.Not allowed to 
directly update the state object.
Third Principle:
"To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers"
Reducer(previousState,action)=>newState
